  <h4>Grading Criteria and Course Policies</h4>
  <h4>Assignments and Course Requirements:</h4>
  <p>Assignments for this course will take the form of Programming Projects, Quizzes, Discussion Board topics, a class Demonstration, and a Final Project.<br><br><b>Course Grade:</b> The course grade will be based on the following:</p>
    <table>
      <tr id="sch"><th id="sch">Assignment</th><th id="sch">Pts</th><th id="sch">#</th><th id="sch">Total Points</th><th id="sch">% of Grade</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Lab</td><td>70</td><td>8</td><td>560</td><td>56%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Quiz</td><td>40</td><td>8</td><td>320</td><td>32%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Discussion</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>64</td><td>6%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Reflection</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>24</td><td>2%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Demo</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>1%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Final demo</td><td>20</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>2%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Totals: </td><td></td><td>34</td><td>1000</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    </table>
  <p><b>Grading Policies:</b> No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment.<br><br>Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100% of the features partially implemented.<br><br>Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><td>A</td><td>>=93</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>A-</td><td>90-92.9</td><td>C-</td><td>70-72.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B+</td><td>87-89.9</td><td>D+</td><td>67-69.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B</td><td>83-86.9</td><td>D</td><td>63-66.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B-</td><td>80-82.9</td><td>D-</td><td>60-62.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>C+</td><td>77-79.9</td><td>F</td><td>60></td></tr>
    <tr><td>C</td><td>73-76.9</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p><b>Course Policies:</b> Class attendance is required unless otherwise specified. During our class time we will remain focused on the topics at hand, avoid utilizing phones or email, and be inclusive of our fellow classmates.<br><br><b>Changes to Course Assignments or Grades:</b> Changes to the course assignments or

  <h4>Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</h4>
  <h4>Responsiveness to Change</h4>
  <p>Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the planned modality this course</p>
  <h4>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</h4>
  <p>Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or college Dean’s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.<br><br>Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.</p>
  <h4>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</h4>
  <p>Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day, cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins</p>

Please make
an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing <a href="learningaccess@lewisu.edu.">learningaccess@lewisu.edu.</a> Since accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more information about academic support services, visit the website at: <a href="www.lewisu.edu/CASE">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a>.<br><br>Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for filesuploaded by instructors.

  <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
  <p>Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level. Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the Provost makes the final decision. </p>
